Description: CSF is an airborne LiDAR (Light Detection and Ranging) ground points filtering algorithm 
    which is based on cloth simulation. It tries to simulate the interactions between the cloth nodes and 
    the corresponding LiDAR points, the locations of the cloth nodes can be determined to generate an 
    approximation of the ground surface.
