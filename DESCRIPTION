Description: CSF is a airborne LiDAR filtering algorithm which is based on cloth simulation. 
It is simply trying to simulate the interactions between the cloth nodes and the corresponding LiDAR points, 
the locations of the cloth nodes can be determined to generate an approximation of the ground surface. 
Then, the ground points can be extracted from the LiDAR point cloud by comparing the original LiDAR points
and the generated surface. Thus, the filtering algorithm could be called cloth simulation filtering, CSF.More details
can be found in W. Zhang, J. Qi*, P. Wan, H. Wang, D. Xie, X. Wang, and G. Yan, “An Easy-to-Use Airborne LiDAR Data
Filtering Method Based on Cloth Simulation,” Remote Sens., vol. 8, no. 6, p. 501, 2016. There are mainly 6 parameters, but
only 3 of them are needed to modified in most of the cases: cloth_resolution ,  rigidness and bSloopSmooth. cloth_resolution
is the density of the cloth particles in the cloth. Usually, this can be set as the average point spacing in the point cloud. 
rigidness usually takes three integer values: 1 is soft cloth for flat terrains, 2 is for rugged terrains and 3 is hard cloth
for terrains with steep slopes. bSloopSmooth is a boolean value for post-processing the steep slopes.
